Here's a detailed step-by-step guide to complete the project using the Azure portal. This includes creating a public Azure Load Balancer, configuring a backend pool with two virtual machines, and setting up Azure Bastion, a NAT Gateway, a virtual network, and necessary subnets.

 Step 1: Create a Resource Group

1. Navigate to the Azure Portal:
   - Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   
2. Create a Resource Group:
   - Click on Create a resource > Resource group.

     - Public IP: None.
   - Click Review + create and then Create.

2. Repeat for VM 2:
   - Follow the same steps as VM 1, but name it `VM2`.

 Step 4: Create a Public IP Address for Load Balancer

1. Create a Public IP Address:
   - Go to Create a resource > Networking > Public IP address.
   - Fill in the required details:
     - Name: Enter a name (e.g., `MyPublicIP`).
     - Region: Select the same region.
     - SKU: Standard.
     - Assignment: Static.
   - Click Review + create and then Create.

 Step 5: Create an Azure Load Balancer

1. Create Load Balancer:
   - Go to Create a resource > Networking > Load Balancer.
   - Fill in the required details:
     - Name: Enter a name (e.g., `MyLoadBalancer`).
     - Region: Select the same region.
     - SKU: Standard.
     - Type: Public.
     - Public IP address: Select the previously created public IP.
   - Click Review + create and then Create.

 Step 6: Configure Backend Pool for Load Balancer

1. Configure Backend Pool:
   - Navigate to the Load Balancer.
   - Click on Backend pools > + Add.
   - Fill in the required details:
     - Name: Enter a name (e.g., `MyBackendPool`).
     - Virtual network: Select the previously created virtual network.
     - Backend pool configurations: Select `IP address` and add the private IP addresses of `VM1` and `VM2`.
   - Click Add.

 Step 7: Create Health Probe

1. Create Health Probe:
   - In the Load Balancer, click on Health probes > + Add.
   - Fill in the required details:
     - Name: Enter a name (e.g., `MyHealthProbe`).
     - Protocol: TCP.
     - Port: 80.
     - Interval: 5.
     - Unhealthy threshold: 2.
   - Click Add.

 Step 8: Create Load Balancer Rule

1. Create Load Balancer Rule:
   - In the Load Balancer, click on Load balancing rules > + Add.
   - Fill in the required details:
     - Name: Enter a name (e.g., `MyLoadBalancingRule`).
     - IP Version: IPv4.
     - Frontend IP address: Select the previously created public IP.
     - Backend pool: Select the previously created backend pool.
     - Protocol: TCP.
     - Port: 80.
     - Backend port: 80.
     - Health probe: Select the previously created health probe.
     - Session persistence: None.
     - Idle timeout (minutes): 4.
   - Click Add.

 Step 9: Set Up Azure Bastion

1. Create Bastion Host:
   - Go to Create a resource > Networking > Bastion.
   - Fill in the required details:
     - Name: Enter a name (e.g., `MyBastionHost`).
     - Region: Select the same region.
     - Virtual network: Select the previously created virtual network.
     - Subnet: Add a new subnet with the name `AzureBastionSubnet` and an address range (e.g., `10.0.3.0/24`).
     - Public IP address: Create a new public IP address.
   - Click Review + create and then Create.

 Step 10: Set Up NAT Gateway

1. Create NAT Gateway:
   - Go to Create a resource > Networking > NAT Gateway.
   - Fill in the required details:
     - Name: Enter a name (e.g., `MyNATGateway`).
     - Region: Select the same region.
     - Public IP addresses: Create or use an existing public IP address.
   - Click Review + create and then Create.

2. Associate NAT Gateway with Subnet:
   - Navigate to the NAT Gateway.
   - Click on Subnets > + Associate.
   - Select the previously created `Subnet-2`.
   - Click OK.

 Step 11: Verify the Setup

1. Verify Load Balancer:
   - Use Azure Bastion to connect to `VM1` and `VM2`.
   - Ensure both VMs have a web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache) running on port 80.
   - Access the public IP address of the Load Balancer from your browser to verify traffic distribution between `VM1` and `VM2`.

2. Verify NAT Gateway:
   - Check that outbound traffic from `VM1` and `VM2` uses the NAT Gateway's public IP.

3. Verify Azure Bastion:
   - Ensure you can connect securely to `VM1` and `VM2` using Azure Bastion.

By following these steps, you can successfully set up a public Azure Load Balancer with a backend pool of two VMs, along with Azure Bastion, a NAT Gateway, a virtual network, and the necessary subnets. This setup ensures secure management and efficient load distribution for your VMs.
